<h1 align="center" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #a8aeb7"> Memory_Duck Generator </h1>
A generator that converts numbers into a phrase that helps memorize the number. Based on the ideology of the Mnemonic Major System (see below). The idea for this project emerged from the principles of Kevin Horsley's book "Unlimited Memory" (A top-300 selling book on Amazon). 

## Project Overview
**Framework:** ASP.NET <br/>
**Team Members:** Patrik Drean, Kevin Horsley<br/>

## Project Details
See NumberMemorizeHelp -> Controllers -> HomeController.cs for details on the logic of the generator.

For details on how the Mnemonic Major System works, see http://memoryduck.somee.com/home/what_is_the_mnemonic_major_system.

Kevin Horsley was more than generous in providing input during the project. 


## Lessons Learned 
<ul>Â  
  <li>I used the steamreader class and learned how to manipulate a text file as a list.</li>
  <li>I learned I am more that capable to take on complicated logic. It's just a matter of taking it a piece at a time. </li>
  <li>It pays off to take risks. I sent a simple video of my app to Kevin Horsley and that was the first step to gaining a great mentor. You're better than you think you are, so don't be scared to take the next step.</li>
</ul>
